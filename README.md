## Overview
### What is the vision of this project?

yelpCamp is an application that will allow users to rate and view others rating and descriptions of campgrounds around the US.  
## What pain point does this web application solve?

It is difficult to get a real feel for a campground from the owner/operators description, they often offer poor web services or over state their offerings.  

## Why should we care about your web application?
As an avid camper this is something that I find very desirable and informative.Having the insight of others who have visited and experienced these places adds a lot of weight and offers great value to making an informed decision.
